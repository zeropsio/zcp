### Bootstrap is two-phase

First call returns `kind: "route-menu"` listing `routeOptions[]` — no
session is open yet. Second call opens the session and returns
`kind: "session-active"`. Read `kind` on every response.

```
zerops_workflow action="start" workflow="bootstrap" intent="<one-sentence>"
   → kind="route-menu", routeOptions=[...]
zerops_workflow action="start" workflow="bootstrap" route="<picked>" \
   recipeSlug="<slug>"   # if route="recipe"
   sessionId="<id>"      # if route="resume"
   → kind="session-active"
```

### Ranked options

| Route | Present when | Carries | Dispatch / rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `resume` | Snapshot has `resumable: true` | `resumeSession`, `resumeServices` | Pick first unless intentionally overriding: `route="resume" sessionId="<resumeSession>"`. |
| `adopt` | Runtime services lack bootstrap records (`not bootstrapped`) | `adoptServices[]` | Use when services match intent; otherwise use classic for non-colliding names. |
| `recipe` | Up to three recipe matches | `recipeSlug`, `confidence`, `collisions[]` | `route="recipe" recipeSlug="<value from routeOptions[].recipeSlug>"`. Copy the slug verbatim from the discover response — corpus slugs don't carry a `zerops-` prefix even when users name a recipe by its branded form (`"zerops-laravel-minimal"`). Collisions recover by runtime rename or same-type managed `resolution: EXISTS`; switch routes only for different-type managed collision or independent infra. |
| `classic` | Always, last | none | `route="classic"` for manual planning. |

### Explicit overrides

Explicit `route` on the first call bypasses discovery. Use only after
prior discovery or direct user route choice. Valid values:
`adopt`, `recipe`, `classic`, `resume`. Empty route re-enters discovery.

### Collision semantics

`collisions[]` annotates recipe options; enforcement happens at plan
submission. Pre-plan hostnames: rename runtimes or set managed deps to
`EXISTS` before submitting.
