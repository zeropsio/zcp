### Write the application code

Bootstrap does NOT ship a verification stub or hello-world — `/var/www/{hostname}/`
on the SSHFS mount is empty. The first deploy only succeeds if real code
is there.

**Checklist before deploying:**

1. **Code reads env vars from the OS at startup.** Never hardcode
   connection strings or host/port/credentials — bootstrap's discovered
   catalog is the authoritative source.
2. **App binds `0.0.0.0`** (not `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`). Zerops health
   checks call the service over the container's external interface; a
   loopback-bound app reports as healthy in tests but fails in
   `zerops_verify`.
3. **`run.start` invokes the production entry point.** Not `npm install`,
   not `build` — the start command must launch a long-running process.
4. **Observability hook** — implement `/status` or `/health` so
   `zerops_verify` has a deterministic endpoint to probe. Return 200 on
   success; embed a cheap dependency check (e.g. `SELECT 1` to the
   database) so a failing verify immediately tells you whether the
   problem is the app or the wiring.

**Write files** directly to `/var/www/{hostname}/` through the SSHFS
mount — Read/Edit/Write tools (and plain `rm`, `mv`, `cp` against mount
paths) all work because the mount bypasses container-side permissions
at the SFTP protocol level.

**Run commands** (`go build`, `php artisan`, `pytest`, framework CLIs,
dev server) via SSH into the container: `ssh {hostname} "cd /var/www
&& <command>"`. The reason is tool availability, not ownership — most
runtime-specific CLIs aren't installed on the ZCP host.

**Don't run `git init` from the ZCP-side mount.** Push-dev deploy
handlers manage the container-side git state — calling `git init` on
the SSHFS mount (`cd /var/www/{hostname}/ && git init`) creates
`.git/objects/` owned by root, which breaks the container-side
`git add` the deploy handler runs. Recovery if this already happened:
`ssh {hostname} "sudo rm -rf /var/www/.git"` — the next deploy
re-initializes it.

SSH deploys replace the container; only content covered by `deployFiles`
survives across deploys.
