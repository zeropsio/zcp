### Write the application code

Inspect `/var/www/<hostname>/` first. If the mount carries source — adapt
to the user's intent; preserve the existing scaffold rather than rewriting.
If empty — scaffold from scratch using the runtime + env-var catalog.
If `ls` errors (stale SSHFS), run `zerops_mount action="mount"` to recover
before deciding.

**Checklist before deploying:**

| Check | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Env vars | Read OS env at startup. Never hardcode connection strings, hosts, ports, or credentials; use bootstrap's discovered catalog. |
| Bind | Listen on `0.0.0.0`, not `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`; loopback can pass local tests but fail `zerops_verify`. |
| Start | `run.start` launches the production entry point as a long-running process. |
| Health | Add `/status` or `/health` returning HTTP 200 so `zerops_verify` has a deterministic endpoint; include a cheap dependency check when useful. |
| Framework defaults | For Streamlit, Gradio, Vite, Jupyter, etc., pin container-correct dev/proxy/headless settings in the framework config. Push-dev creates `/var/www/.git`, so auto-detecting dev mode from parent `.git/` misfires. Don't suppress dev mode — fix the operational mismatch and keep hot-reload. |

**Mount for files, SSH for commands.** Runtime CLIs (`go build`,
`php artisan`, `pytest`) need SSH because most are not on the ZCP host.

**Don't run `git init` from the ZCP-side mount.** Push-dev deploy
handlers manage the runtime container-side git state; running `git init` on
the SSHFS mount creates root-owned `.git/objects/` that breaks the
runtime container-side `git add`. Recovery: `ssh <hostname> "sudo rm -rf
/var/www/.git"` — the next redeploy re-initializes it.
