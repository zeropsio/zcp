### Platform rules

- **Runtime user is `zerops`, not root.** Package installs need `sudo`
  (`sudo apk add …` on Alpine, `sudo apt-get install …` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- **Deploy = new container.** Local files in the current runtime container are
  lost; only content covered by `deployFiles` survives across redeploys.
- **Setup blocks (`prod`, `stage`, `dev`) are canonical recipe names,
  NOT hostnames.** Each block deploys independently.
- **Build ≠ runtime container.** Runtime packages → `run.prepareCommands`;
  build-only packages → `build.prepareCommands`. Build-time tools may
  not exist at run time; see guide `deployment-lifecycle`.
- Env vars use `${hostname_KEY}` syntax for cross-service references
  (Zerops rewrites at deploy from the named service's catalog). Local
  vars in `run.envVariables` shadow project-level entries with the
  same key.
- Service config changes (shared storage, scaling, nginx fragments):
  use `zerops_import` with `override: true` to update existing services.
  This is separate from `zerops_deploy`, which only updates code.
  **Destructive**: override REPLACES the service stack — the running
  container, deployed code, per-service env vars, and any
  work-in-progress on the service's filesystem are all torn down. The
  response Warnings name the replaced hostnames; back up first.
