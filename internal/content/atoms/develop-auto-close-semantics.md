### Work session auto-close

Auto-close is gated on every in-scope service carrying `closeDeployMode ∈ {auto, git-push}`. Services with `closeDeployMode=unset` or `closeDeployMode=manual` BLOCK the auto-close trigger — the session stays open until you either pick a close-mode for those services or call `action="close"` explicitly. (Verified by `internal/workflow/work_session_test.go::TestEvaluateAutoClose` — `unset_blocks` and `manual_blocks` both return `want: false`.)

When the gate is open (every in-scope service is `auto` or `git-push`), the session closes automatically under either of two conditions:

- **`auto-complete`** — every service in scope has both a successful
  deploy and a passing verify. The envelope's `workSession.closedAt`
  becomes set, `closeReason: auto-complete`, and `phase` flips to
  the closed state.
- **`iteration-cap`** — the workflow's retry ceiling was hit. Same
  close-state shape; `closeReason: iteration-cap`.

Explicit `zerops_workflow action="close" workflow="develop"` emits
the same closed state manually and is rarely needed — starting a new
task with a different `intent` replaces the session.

Close scope follows the session topology: standard-mode pairs include
BOTH halves, so skipping the stage cross-deploy leaves the session
active. Dev-only or simple services close after their one successful
deploy + verify.

Close is cleanup, not commitment. Work itself is durable — code is
in git, infrastructure is on Zerops.
