### Reference by name in container-side commands

When SSHing into a container to run a command that needs a secret
(psql, prisma, redis-cli, curl auth header), refer to the env var by
name in a **single-quoted** command body. Bash inside the runtime container
expands it at exec time from its already-injected OS env — the value
never enters your context.

Reference the name THIS service has in its OWN env: a var its
`run.envVariables` defined (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`), an inherited project
var, or its own secret. A sibling's bare `${db_*}` is NOT in your
container under the default service isolation — only the name your
service imported it under resolves.

```bash
# WRONG — value pasted from earlier discover output into the command
ssh apidev 'npx prisma migrate --url postgresql://postgres:U_UjIq5TC...@db:5432/db'

# RIGHT — single-quoted; $DATABASE_URL is apidev's OWN run.envVariables
# var (e.g. DATABASE_URL: ${db_connectionString}), expanded at exec time
ssh apidev 'npx prisma migrate --url "$DATABASE_URL"'
```

Same for `curl` auth headers (`Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN`),
`redis-cli`, `aws s3` — reference the name your service defined.

**Read vs use.** Inspecting values for diagnosis is fine — mask in
output so secrets don't enter your context:

```bash
ssh apidev 'env | grep -E "^(DB_|APP_)" | sed "s/=.*/=<set>/"'
```

If you DO pull values into context (export classification, debugging
an unresolved ref), the next command should still reference by
`${name}`, not the value you just saw.
