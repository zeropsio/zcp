description: "Standard dev+stage pair, close-mode auto on both halves, both deployed."
---
### Development & Deploy

Infrastructure is provisioned and at least one runtime already has a
successful first deploy on record. You're in the edit loop: discover
the current state, implement the user's request, redeploy, verify.

---

### Every code change must reach a durable state

Iteration cadence is mode-specific:

- Dev-mode dynamic runtime: edit code in place; reload via
  `zerops_dev_server` (no full redeploy for code-only changes).
- Simple / standard / local / first-deploy: every change →
  `zerops_deploy`.

Once close-mode is `auto` or `git-push` and every resolved deploy
target is deployed + verified, the work session auto-closes.

---

### Two deploy classes

| Class | Trigger | `deployFiles` constraint | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-deploy** | `sourceService == targetService`, or omitted and inferred to target | MUST be `[.]` or `[./]`; narrower patterns destroy target source | dev/simple mutable workspace |
| **Cross-deploy** | `sourceService != targetService`, or `strategy=git-push` | Cherry-pick build output: `./out`, `./dist`, `./build` | dev→stage promotion; stage runs foreground binaries |

Self-deploy refreshes a **mutable workspace**; cross-deploy produces an
**immutable artifact** from build-container output after `buildCommands`.

### Picking deployFiles

| Setup block purpose | deployFiles | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Self-deploy (dev, simple modes) | `[.]` | Anything narrower destroys target on deploy. |
| Cross-deploy, preserve dir | `[./out]` | Lands at `/var/www/out/...`; use when `start` references that path or artifacts live in subdirs. |
| Cross-deploy, extract contents | `[./out/~]` | Tilde strips `out/`; use when runtime expects assets at `/var/www/`. |

### Why the source tree sometimes doesn't have `./out`

`deployFiles` is evaluated against the **build container filesystem
after `buildCommands`**, NOT the editor tree. `deployFiles: [./out]`
is correct even when `./out` is absent locally; the build creates it.
See guide `deployment-lifecycle`.

ZCP pre-flight does NOT check cross-deploy path existence; Zerops
builder emits `WARN: deployFiles paths not found: ...` in
`DeployResult.BuildLogs` only if the build produces no matches.

---

### Env var channels

Channel determines when a value goes live.

| Channel | Set with | When live |
|---|---|---|
| Service-level env | `zerops_env action="set"` | `restartedServices` lists cycled runtime containers; `restartedProcesses` has Process details. |
| `run.envVariables` | Edit `zerops.yaml`, commit, deploy | Full redeploy. `zerops_manage action="reload"` does NOT pick them up. |
| `build.envVariables` | Edit `zerops.yaml`, commit, deploy | Next build uses them; not visible at runtime. |

**Suppress restart**: pass `skipRestart=true`; response reports
`restartSkipped: true`, `nextActions` says how to restart, and the value
is **not live** until then. Partial failures land in `restartWarnings`;
`stored` confirms landed keys.

**Layer precedence — yaml-baked > service > project.** A key baked by
`run.envVariables` can't be set at service scope (`userDataDuplicateKey`,
the two never coexist) — edit `zerops.yaml` + redeploy to change it. The
reverse is silent: a `project=true` set of a key some service bakes (or
sets at service scope) stores fine, but that service keeps its higher
value — `shadowWarnings` names the key + service and `nextActions` won't
call it live. Fix at the winning layer. A self-shadow (`KEY: ${KEY}`) is
different: one self-referential line, not two layers.

---

### HTTP diagnostics

For 500 / 502 / empty body, stop at the first useful signal; do **not**
default to
`ssh appdev curl localhost` for diagnosis.

1. **`zerops_verify serviceHostname="appdev"`** — start with the
   canonical health probe and structured diagnosis (it picks the right
   check route per service shape).
2. **Subdomain URL** — static / implicit-webserver:
   `https://appdev-${zeropsSubdomainHost}.prg1.zerops.app/`; dynamic
   adds `-{port}`. `${zeropsSubdomainHost}` is numeric and project-scope,
   not the projectId. Read it with `env | grep zeropsSubdomainHost`, or
   use `zerops_discover` for the resolved URL. Do not guess a UUID.
3. **`zerops_logs severity="error" since="5m"`** — recent platform errors
   (nginx, crash traces, deploy failures) without opening a shell.
4. **Framework log file** — read via Read tool at the framework's
   project-relative log path (`storage/logs/laravel.log`,
   `var/log/...`). Path resolves against the runtime root configured
   for the active environment.
5. **Last resort: SSH + curl localhost** — only when earlier checks miss
   container-local state (worker-only service, non-default bind). Even
   then, `zerops_verify` usually already encodes the check.

---

### Platform rules

- **Runtime user is `zerops`, not root.** Package installs need `sudo`
  (`sudo apk add …` on Alpine, `sudo apt-get install …` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- **Deploy = new container.** Local files in the current runtime container are
  lost; only content covered by `deployFiles` survives across redeploys.
- **Setup blocks (`prod`, `stage`, `dev`) are canonical recipe names,
  NOT hostnames.** Each block deploys independently.
- **Build ≠ runtime container.** Runtime packages → `run.prepareCommands`;
  build-only packages → `build.prepareCommands`. Build-time tools may
  not exist at run time; see guide `deployment-lifecycle`.
- Cross-service env vars use `${hostname_KEY}` syntax and must be
  declared in `run.envVariables` under an own-key alias to reach the
  app process. Project-level vars auto-inherit; same-key declaration
  (`API_URL: ${API_URL}`) produces a literal-string shadow.
- **`zerops_import override=true` is destructive** — REPLACES the
  service stack (container, code, env vars, filesystem). Reserved for
  explicit user-requested config changes (shared storage, scaling,
  nginx) that `zerops_deploy` can't handle. Never the default fix for
  hostname collisions, env drift, or unexpected state — pick a
  different hostname, adopt, or escalate. Back up first; Warnings
  name replaced hostnames.

---

This service is on `closeDeployMode=auto`. Your delivery pattern is direct `zerops_deploy` calls via zcli — fast, synchronous, the canonical default for tight iteration cycles. `action="close"` itself is a session-teardown call regardless of close-mode; auto-close fires when the deploys you ran during iterations satisfy the green-scope gate.

## How auto-close fires

When auto-close conditions land (every service in scope has a successful deploy + passed verify), ZCP closes the develop session automatically. The deploys that landed during develop iterations ARE the close deploys — there's no separate close-time push, and no special call from the close handler.

The env-specific mechanics (SSH push from `/var/www` for container, `zcli push` from CWD for local) live in the env-scoped deploy guidance fired alongside this atom.

## When you might switch

`auto` is great for "make a change, see it live, repeat." If the workflow grows — multiple contributors landing changes, CI pipelines that should run before deploy, release branches — switch:

- `git-push` if pushing to a git remote should trigger the build (Zerops webhook or GitHub Actions). After the close-mode flip, `action=git-push-setup` provisions the capability.
- `manual` if external orchestration owns close decisions. ZCP still records every deploy/verify; auto-close just doesn't fire.

Switch close-mode per service:

```
zerops_workflow action="close-mode" closeMode={"appdev":"git-push"}
zerops_workflow action="close-mode" closeMode={"appstage":"git-push"}
```

(Replace `git-push` with `manual` to yield to user orchestration.) The default stays auto until you explicitly switch.

---

### Self-deploy destruction risk

In a self-deploy, `sourceService == targetService` — the runtime is both
the build source AND the destination. `deployFiles` selects which build
artifacts overwrite the runtime's deploy root. When that selection is
narrower than `[.]`, the result destroys the target.

When a self-deploying service uses a narrower deployFiles pattern (e.g. `[./out]`):

1. The build container assembles the artifact from the upload + any `buildCommands` output.
2. `deployFiles` selects — with a cherry-pick pattern, only the selected subset enters the artifact.
3. The runtime container's `/var/www/` is **overwritten** with that subset — source files disappear.
4. On subsequent self-deploys, `zerops_deploy` finds no source to upload — the target is unrecoverable without a manual re-push from elsewhere.

Client-side pre-flight rejects this with `INVALID_ZEROPS_YML` before any build triggers, so this failure mode cannot reach Zerops. (The atom fires for `closeDeployModes:[auto, manual, unset]` because git-push delivery uses cross-deploy semantics where this risk class doesn't apply.)

---

### Dynamic-runtime dev server

Dev-mode dynamic runtimes deploy with `run.start` omitted — the
runtime container idles and no dev process is live until you start
one. Action family on `zerops_dev_server`:

| Action | Use | Args |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | check before `start` (idempotent) — avoids duplicate listener | `hostname port healthPath` |
| `start` | spawn the dev process | `hostname command port healthPath` |
| `restart` | survives-the-deploy config/code change | `hostname command port healthPath` |
| `logs` | tail recent for diagnosis | `hostname logLines=40` |
| `stop` | end of session, free the port | `hostname port` |

Args:
- `command` — exact `run.start` from `zerops.yaml`.
- `port` — `run.ports[0].port`.
- `healthPath` — app-owned (`/api/health`, `/status`) or `/`.

Response carries `running`, `healthStatus`, `reason`, and `logTail`
— read these before making another call.

Don't hand-roll `ssh appdev "cmd &"`: the SSH session ends with
the call and kills the process. Always go through `zerops_dev_server`.

---

### Reference by name in container-side commands

When SSHing into a container to run a command that needs a secret
(psql, prisma, redis-cli, curl auth header), refer to the env var by
name in a **single-quoted** command body. Bash inside the runtime container
expands it at exec time from its already-injected OS env — the value
never enters your context.

```bash
# WRONG — value pasted from earlier discover output into the command
ssh apidev 'npx prisma migrate --url postgresql://postgres:U_UjIq5TC...@db:5432/db'

# RIGHT — single-quoted, ${db_*} expanded at exec time inside apidev
ssh apidev 'npx prisma migrate --url postgresql://${db_superUser}:${db_superUserPassword}@${db_hostname}:${db_port}/${db_dbName}'
```

Same for `curl` auth headers (`Authorization: Bearer ${api_token}`),
`redis-cli`, `aws s3`, anything that takes a secret on the command line.

**Read vs use.** Inspecting values for diagnosis is fine — mask in
output so secrets don't enter your context:

```bash
ssh apidev 'env | grep -E "^(DB_|APP_)" | sed "s/=.*/=<set>/"'
```

If you DO pull values into context (export classification, debugging
an unresolved ref), the next command should still reference by
`${name}`, not the value you just saw.

---

### Knowledge on demand — where to pull extra context

When the embedded guidance is not enough, these are the canonical lookups:

- **`zerops.yaml` schema / field reference**:
  `zerops_knowledge query="zerops.yaml schema"`
- **Runtime-specific docs** (build tools, start commands, conventions):
  `zerops_knowledge query="<your runtime>"` — e.g. `nodejs`, `go`,
  `php-apache`, `bun`. Match the base stack name of the service you are
  working with.
- **Env var keys** (no values — safe by default):
  `zerops_discover includeEnvs=true`. Add `includeEnvValues=true` only
  for troubleshooting.
- **Infrastructure changes** (shared storage, scaling rules, nginx
  fragments): platform-rules guidance in the develop response covers
  base mechanics; deeper detail comes from `zerops_knowledge
  query="<topic>"`. For dev → standard mode expansion, start a new
  bootstrap session with `isExisting=true` on the existing runtime
  plus a `stageHostname` for the new stage pair.
- **Platform constants** (status codes, managed service categories,
  runtime classes): `zerops_knowledge query="<topic>"` — examples:
  `"service status"`, `"managed services"`, `"subdomain"`.

---

### Work session auto-close

Auto-close is gated on every in-scope service carrying `closeDeployMode ∈ {auto, git-push}`. Services with `closeDeployMode=unset` or `closeDeployMode=manual` BLOCK the auto-close trigger — the session stays open until you either pick a close-mode for those services or call `action="close"` explicitly.

When the gate is open (every in-scope service is `auto` or `git-push`), the session closes automatically under either of two conditions:

- **`auto-complete`** — every service in scope has both a successful
  deploy and a passing verify. The envelope's `workSession.closedAt`
  becomes set, `closeReason: auto-complete`, and `phase` flips to
  the closed state.
- **`iteration-cap`** — the workflow's retry ceiling was hit. Same
  close-state shape; `closeReason: iteration-cap`.

Explicit `zerops_workflow action="close" workflow="develop"` emits
the same closed state manually and is rarely needed — starting a new
task with a different `intent` replaces the session.

Close scope follows the session topology: standard-mode pairs include
BOTH halves, so skipping the stage cross-deploy leaves the session
active. Dev-only or simple services close after their one successful
deploy + verify.

Close is cleanup, not commitment. Work itself is durable — code is
in git, infrastructure is on Zerops.

---

### Per-service verify matrix

Deploy success does not prove user behavior. Use `zerops_discover`:
subdomain URL means web-facing; managed/no HTTP port means non-web.

Run `zerops_verify` first. If any returned check has a `recovery` field,
execute that recovery (`tool` + `action` + `args`) and re-run verify before
any browser/HTTP probe.

If you adopted or imported a service that you deliberately want to keep
without a public subdomain (internal-only HTTP service), call
`zerops_subdomain action="disable"` after the next deploy.

| Service shape | Required check |
|---|---|
| Non-web: managed DB/cache/worker/no HTTP port | Run `zerops_verify serviceHostname="{targetHostname}"`. `status=healthy` is enough; nothing to browse. |
| Web-facing: dynamic/static/implicit-webserver with subdomain/port | Run `zerops_verify` for infrastructure, then a verify agent using `agent-browser`. Tool healthy + rendered page proves the service; either failure blocks. |

Fetch the web-agent protocol only when needed:

```
zerops_knowledge query="verify web agent protocol"
```

It has the `Agent(model="sonnet", prompt=...)` template; substitute
`{targetHostname}` and `{runtime}`.

### Verdict protocol

- **VERDICT: PASS** → service verified, proceed.
- **VERDICT: FAIL** → visual/functional issue; iterate from the agent's
  evidence.
- **VERDICT: UNCERTAIN** → fall back to `zerops_verify`; the agent could
  not determine the outcome.
- **Malformed output or timeout** → UNCERTAIN; fall back to `zerops_verify`.

---

### Platform rules — container additions

- **Mount caveats.** Mount is the build source for each new container.
  Never `ssh <hostname> cat/ls/tail …` for mount files — SSH adds
  shell-escape bugs (nested quotes in `sed`/`awk` break). One-shot
  SSH is for runtime CLIs only.
- **Long-running dev processes → `zerops_dev_server`.** Don't
  hand-roll `ssh <hostname> "cmd &"` — backgrounded SSH holds the
  channel until the 120 s bash timeout. The dev-server response
  carries `running`, `healthStatus`, `startMillis`, and on failure
  a `reason` code — read it before another call.
- **One-shot commands over SSH.** Framework CLIs, git ops,
  `curl localhost` exit quickly — no channel-lifetime concern:

  ```
  ssh <hostname> "cd /var/www && npm install"
  ssh <hostname> "cd /var/www && php artisan migrate"
  ssh <hostname> "curl -s http://localhost:{port}/api/health"
  ```

- **Mount recovery.** If the SSHFS mount goes stale after a deploy
  (stat/ls returns empty, writes hang), remount: `zerops_mount action="mount"`.
- **Agent Browser** — `agent-browser.dev` is available on the ZCP host
  for browser-backed verify checks (`zerops_verify` selects the right
  route per service shape).

---

### Deploy config — current axes + how to change

Each runtime service has three orthogonal deploy-config axes — the
rendered Services block shows them as
`closeMode=auto|git-push|manual gitPush=unconfigured|configured|broken|unknown buildIntegration=none|webhook|actions`:

- `closeMode` — what the develop close action does. `auto` runs
  `zerops_deploy` directly (zcli push); `git-push` commits + pushes
  to a configured remote so Zerops/CI builds; `manual` yields to
  you for orchestration. `unset` is the bootstrap-written
  placeholder that develop converts on first use.
- `gitPush` — capability state for the git-push path. `configured`
  means the last `git-push-setup` probe **proved end-to-end auth**: the
  supplied token authenticates against the remote URL, project env carries
  `GIT_TOKEN` (sensitive), and the working tree's git config has its
  `origin` synced. `unconfigured` / `broken` indicate setup is
  needed before `closeMode=git-push` can fire (`broken` means a previously-
  configured token stopped working, e.g. PAT rotation).
- `buildIntegration` — the ZCP-managed CI shape that was picked. `actions`
  (GitHub Actions workflow + secrets), `webhook` (Zerops dashboard OAuth),
  or `none`. Requires `gitPush=configured`. The flag records the choice
  and the handoff shape (workflow YAML body / dashboard URL); workflow
  commit, secrets landing, and OAuth completion happen outside ZCP's
  reach and are not verified by this flag. Treat as "this is the
  integration shape we wired", not "the build trigger is confirmed live".

Switch any axis without closing the session — three actions, each
operating at a different scope:

- `close-mode` is **per-pair** under the hood (one ServiceMeta per dev/stage pair) but accepts a multi-entry map: one call sets close-mode for any subset of services. Passing both halves of a pair with the SAME value is accepted (canonical write once). Passing both halves with DIFFERENT values is rejected with an explicit conflict diagnostic — pick one value for the pair.
- `git-push-setup` and `build-integration` are **per-pair**: capability is stamped on the dev half's meta and shared by both halves. `git-push-setup` rejects stage-half input with `INVALID_PARAMETER` (it mutates push-side state — would write to the wrong target). `build-integration` is permissive: pair-keyed lookup resolves either half to the dev meta and the response carries `pushSource`/`buildTarget`/`topologyNote` so the redirect is visible. Either way: prefer passing the dev half directly.

```
zerops_workflow action="close-mode" closeMode={"appdev":"auto"}
zerops_workflow action="git-push-setup" service="appdev" remoteUrl="..."
zerops_workflow action="build-integration" service="appdev" integration="actions"
```

Substitute `appdev` with the dev-half hostname (or single-runtime hostname). For a multi-service project, repeat each call once per dev-half service — never per stage-half.

Mixed config across services in one project is fine — each service's three axes are independent in the envelope.

---

### Closing the task

Deploy dev first, start the dev server, verify, then promote to stage. Run per dev/stage pair in scope:

```
zerops_deploy targetService="appdev" setup="dev"
zerops_dev_server action=start hostname="appdev" command="{start-command}" port={port} healthPath="{path}"
zerops_verify serviceHostname="appdev"

zerops_deploy sourceService="appdev" targetService="appstage" setup="prod"
zerops_verify serviceHostname="appstage"
```

Cross-deploy builds the dev source on stage (dev side unchanged); stage has a real `run.start` + `healthCheck`, so it auto-starts (no `zerops_dev_server` on the stage side). The work session closes once both halves have a successful deploy + passing verify (`closeReason=auto-complete`). If the dev server is already running after a code-only change, run `action=status` first; if `running: true`, skip `action=start`.
