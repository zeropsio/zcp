### Development & Deploy

Infrastructure is provisioned and at least one runtime already has a
successful first deploy on record. You're in the edit loop: discover
the current state, implement the user's request, redeploy, verify.

---

### Read `apiMeta` on every error response

Any `zerops_*` tool surfacing a Zerops API 4xx may include `apiMeta`.
Missing key = no server detail; present key = exact rejected fields.

Shape:

```json
{
  "code": "API_ERROR",
  "apiCode": "projectImportInvalidParameter",
  "error": "Invalid parameter provided.",
  "suggestion": "Zerops flagged specific fields — see apiMeta for each field's failure reason.",
  "apiMeta": [
    {
      "code": "projectImportInvalidParameter",
      "error": "Invalid parameter provided.",
      "metadata": {
        "storage.mode": ["mode not supported"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each `apiMeta[].metadata` key is a **field path** (`appdev.mode`,
`build.base`, `parameter`); values list reasons. Fix those YAML fields
and retry — do not guess.

Common `apiCode` shapes:

| `apiCode` | `metadata` key | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `projectImportInvalidParameter` | `<host>.mode` | type/mode combination not allowed |
| `projectImportMissingParameter` | `parameter` (value `<host>.mode`) | required field missing |
| `serviceStackTypeNotFound` | `serviceStackTypeVersion` | version string not in platform catalog |
| `zeropsYamlInvalidParameter` | `build.base` etc. | zerops.yaml validator caught the field pre-build |
| `yamlValidationInvalidYaml` | `reason` (with `line N:`) | YAML syntax error |

Per-service import failures use `serviceErrors[].meta` with the same
shape, one entry per failing service-stack.

---

### Every code change must reach a durable state

Iteration cadence is mode-specific:

- Dev-mode dynamic runtime container: see
  `develop-close-mode-auto-workflow-dev`.
- Simple / standard / local / first-deploy: every change →
  `zerops_deploy`.

Auto-close: see `develop-auto-close-semantics`.

---

### close-mode=auto Deploy

The dev container uses SSH push — `zerops_deploy` uploads the working tree from `/var/www/<hostname>/` straight into the service without a git remote. No credentials on your side: `zerops_deploy` SSHes using ZCP's runtime container internal key. The response's `mode` is `ssh`; `sourceService` and `targetService` identify the deploy class.

- Self-deploy (single service): `sourceService == targetService`, class is self.
- Cross-deploy (dev → stage): class is cross — emit `sourceService` and `targetService` separately.

```
zerops_deploy targetService="appdev"
```

`deployFiles` discipline differs per class: self-deploy needs `[.]` (narrower patterns destroy the target's source); cross-deploy cherry-picks build output. See `develop-deploy-modes` for the full rule and `develop-deploy-files-self-deploy` for the self-deploy invariant.

---

### Two deploy classes

| Class | Trigger | `deployFiles` constraint | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-deploy** | `sourceService == targetService`, or omitted and inferred to target | MUST be `[.]` or `[./]`; narrower patterns destroy target source | dev/simple mutable workspace |
| **Cross-deploy** | `sourceService != targetService`, or `strategy=git-push` | Cherry-pick build output: `./out`, `./dist`, `./build` | dev→stage promotion; stage runs foreground binaries |

Self-deploy refreshes a **mutable workspace**; cross-deploy produces an
**immutable artifact** from build-container output after `buildCommands`.

### Picking deployFiles

| Setup block purpose | deployFiles | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Self-deploy (dev, simple modes) | `[.]` | Anything narrower destroys target on deploy. |
| Cross-deploy, preserve dir | `[./out]` | Lands at `/var/www/out/...`; use when `start` references that path or artifacts live in subdirs. |
| Cross-deploy, extract contents | `[./out/~]` | Tilde strips `out/`; use when runtime expects assets at `/var/www/`. |

### Why the source tree sometimes doesn't have `./out`

`deployFiles` is evaluated against the **build container filesystem
after `buildCommands`**, NOT the editor tree. `deployFiles: [./out]`
is correct even when `./out` is absent locally; the build creates it.
See guide `deployment-lifecycle`.

ZCP pre-flight does NOT check cross-deploy path existence; Zerops
builder emits `WARN: deployFiles paths not found: ...` in
`DeployResult.BuildLogs` only if the build produces no matches.

---

### Dev-server state triage

Before deploying, verifying, or iterating on a runtime service, run
the triage rather than blind-starting a process.

**Step 1 — Determine the expectation** from `runtimeClass` + `mode`
in the envelope:

Only `runtimeClass: dynamic` + `mode: dev` needs a manual dev-server
action — its `zsc noop` idle runtime container waits for `zerops_dev_server
action=start`. Implicit-webserver, static, and dynamic + simple/stage
are platform-owned post-deploy; triage ends there.

**Step 2 — Check current state** for dev-mode dynamic:

```
# container env
zerops_dev_server action=status hostname="appdev" port={port} healthPath="{path}"

# local env — runs on your machine
Bash command="curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' --max-time 2 http://localhost:{port}{path}"
```

Read the response:

- `running: true` with HTTP 2xx/3xx/4xx `healthStatus` → proceed to
  `zerops_verify`.
- `running: false` with `reason: health_probe_connection_refused` →
  start (step 3).
- `running: true` with `healthStatus: 5xx` → server runs but is
  broken; read logs and response body; do NOT restart (does not
  fix bugs). Edit code, then follow the mode-specific iteration
  cadence in `develop-change-drives-deploy`.

For workers with no HTTP surface (`port=0`, `healthPath=""`), skip
HTTP status; call `zerops_logs` to confirm consumption.

**Step 3 — Act on the delta.**

```
# container env
zerops_dev_server action=start hostname="appdev" command="{start-command}" port={port} healthPath="{path}"

# local env
Bash run_in_background=true command="{start-command}"
```

After every redeploy the dev process is gone — re-run Step 2 before
`zerops_verify`.

---

### Env var channels

Channel determines when a value goes live.

| Channel | Set with | When live |
|---|---|---|
| Service-level env | `zerops_env action="set"` | `restartedServices` lists cycled runtime containers; `restartedProcesses` has Process details. |
| `run.envVariables` | Edit `zerops.yaml`, commit, deploy | Full redeploy. `zerops_manage action="reload"` does NOT pick them up. |
| `build.envVariables` | Edit `zerops.yaml`, commit, deploy | Next build uses them; not visible at runtime. |

**Suppress restart**: pass `skipRestart=true`; response reports
`restartSkipped: true`, `nextActions` says how to restart, and the value
is **not live** until then. Partial failures land in `restartWarnings`;
`stored` confirms landed keys.

**Shadow-loop pitfall**: `zerops_env`-set service-level vars shadow
the same key in `run.envVariables`. Fixing only `zerops.yaml` won't
change live value — delete the service-level key
(`zerops_env action="delete"`) before redeploy.

---

### HTTP diagnostics

For 500 / 502 / empty body, stop at the first useful signal; do **not**
default to
`ssh appdev curl localhost` for diagnosis.

1. **`zerops_verify serviceHostname="appdev"`** — start with the
   canonical health probe and structured diagnosis; see
   `develop-verify-matrix` for the full verify path.
2. **Subdomain URL** — static / implicit-webserver:
   `https://appdev-${zeropsSubdomainHost}.prg1.zerops.app/`; dynamic
   adds `-{port}`. `${zeropsSubdomainHost}` is numeric and project-scope,
   not the projectId. Read it with `env | grep zeropsSubdomainHost`, or
   use `zerops_discover` for the resolved URL. Do not guess a UUID.
3. **`zerops_logs severity="error" since="5m"`** — recent platform errors
   (nginx, crash traces, deploy failures) without opening a shell.
4. **Framework log file** — read via Read tool at the framework's
   project-relative log path (`storage/logs/laravel.log`,
   `var/log/...`). Per-env access detail in
   `develop-platform-rules-container` (mount-vs-SSH split) and
   `develop-platform-rules-local` (CWD reads).
5. **Last resort: SSH + curl localhost** — only when earlier checks miss
   container-local state (worker-only service, non-default bind). Even
   then, `zerops_verify` usually already encodes the check.

---

### Platform rules

- **Runtime user is `zerops`, not root.** Package installs need `sudo`
  (`sudo apk add …` on Alpine, `sudo apt-get install …` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- **Deploy = new container.** Local files in the current runtime container are
  lost; only content covered by `deployFiles` survives across redeploys.
- **Setup blocks (`prod`, `stage`, `dev`) are canonical recipe names,
  NOT hostnames.** Each block deploys independently.
- **Build ≠ runtime container.** Runtime packages → `run.prepareCommands`;
  build-only packages → `build.prepareCommands`. Build-time tools may
  not exist at run time; see guide `deployment-lifecycle`.
- Env var live timing and cross-service syntax:
  `develop-env-var-channels` / `develop-first-deploy-env-vars`.
- Service config changes (shared storage, scaling, nginx fragments):
  use `zerops_import` with `override: true` to update existing services.
  This is separate from `zerops_deploy`, which only updates code.
  **Destructive**: override REPLACES the service stack — the running
  container, deployed code, per-service env vars, and any
  work-in-progress on the service's filesystem are all torn down. The
  response Warnings name the replaced hostnames; back up first.

---

### Checklist (dev-mode dynamic-runtime services)

Applies to **dynamic runtimes only** (Node, Bun, Deno, Go, Rust, Python,
Ruby, Java, .NET — anything with a long-running app process under
manual control). For implicit-webserver runtimes (`php-apache`,
`php-nginx`) see `develop-implicit-webserver`; for static runtimes the
web server auto-starts and this checklist does not apply.

- Dev setup block in `zerops.yaml`: `start: zsc noop --silent`, **no**
  `healthCheck`. Zerops keeps the runtime container idle; you start
  the dev process yourself via `zerops_dev_server action=start` after
  each deploy.
- Stage setup block (if a dev+stage pair exists): real `start:`
  command **plus** a `healthCheck`. Stage auto-starts on deploy and
  Zerops probes it on its configured interval.

---

This service is on `closeDeployMode=auto`. Your delivery pattern is direct `zerops_deploy` calls via zcli — fast, synchronous, the canonical default for tight iteration cycles. `action="close"` itself is a session-teardown call regardless of close-mode; auto-close fires when the deploys you ran during iterations satisfy the green-scope gate.

## How auto-close fires

When auto-close conditions land (every service in scope has a successful deploy + passed verify), ZCP closes the develop session automatically. The deploys that landed during develop iterations ARE the close deploys — there's no separate close-time push, and no special call from the close handler.

The mechanics underneath:

| environment | what `zerops_deploy` does |
|---|---|
| container | SSH to the dev hostname → `zcli push` from `/var/www` to the runtime. Synchronous: deploy result lands when the build pipeline completes. |
| local | `zcli push` from the local workspace to the linked Zerops stage. Same shape, different source. |

## When you might switch

`auto` is great for "make a change, see it live, repeat." If the workflow grows — multiple contributors landing changes, CI pipelines that should run before deploy, release branches — switch:

- `git-push` if pushing to a git remote should trigger the build (Zerops webhook or GitHub Actions). After the close-mode flip, `action=git-push-setup` provisions the capability.
- `manual` if external orchestration owns close decisions. ZCP still records every deploy/verify; auto-close just doesn't fire.

Switch close-mode per service:

```
zerops_workflow action="close-mode" closeMode={"appdev":"git-push"}
```

(Replace `git-push` with `manual` to yield to user orchestration.) The default stays auto until you explicitly switch.

---

### Development workflow

Edit code at `/var/www/<hostname>/` for each in-scope dev runtime. **Verify the dev process is up first** — every redeploy drops it, and the deployed-state axis only confirms a deploy landed at some point, not that the dev server is currently live. Run `zerops_dev_server action=status hostname="appdev" port={port} healthPath="{path}"` per service; if `running: false`, run `action=start` (see `develop-dynamic-runtime-start-container`). **Code-only edits never trigger `zerops_deploy`** — deploy is for `zerops.yaml` changes only (see "**`zerops.yaml` changes**" below).

**Code-only edit cycle**:
- Dev runners with file-watch (`npm run dev`, `vite`, `nodemon`, `air`, `fastapi --reload`) pick up edits **only when configured for polling** — SSHFS does not surface inotify events. Set `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1` (vite/webpack), `--poll` (nodemon), or the runner's equivalent.
- Otherwise (non-watching runner, polling not configured, OR the process died), restart the dev server per service:

```
zerops_dev_server action=restart hostname="appdev" command="{start-command}" port={port} healthPath="{path}"
```

  The response carries `running`, `healthStatus`, `startMillis`, and on failure a `reason` code (see `develop-dev-server-reason-codes`) — read it before issuing another call.

**`zerops.yaml` changes** (env vars, ports, run-block fields): `zerops_deploy` first; container is replaced; on the rebuilt runtime container use `action=start` (NOT restart). See `develop-platform-rules-common` for the deploy=new-container rule.

**Diagnostic**: tail the log ring per service:

```
zerops_dev_server action=logs hostname="appdev" logLines=60
```

`reason` classifies the failure (connection refused, HTTP 5xx, spawn timeout, worker exit) without a follow-up call.

---

### Self-deploy invariant

Any service self-deploying MUST have `deployFiles: [.]` or `[./]` in
the matching setup block. See `develop-deploy-modes` for how ZCP
classifies self-deploy vs cross-deploy.

A narrower pattern destroys the target's working tree on the next
deploy:

1. The build container assembles the artifact from the upload + any
   `buildCommands` output.
2. `deployFiles` selects — with a cherry-pick pattern like `[./out]`,
   only the selected subset enters the artifact.
3. The runtime container's `/var/www/` is **overwritten** with that subset —
   source files disappear.
4. On subsequent self-deploys, `zerops_deploy` finds no source to
   upload — the target is unrecoverable without a manual re-push from
   elsewhere.

Client-side pre-flight rejects this with
`INVALID_ZEROPS_YML` before any build triggers, so this failure mode
cannot reach Zerops.

Cross-deploy has opposite semantics; see `develop-deploy-modes` for
the full contrast.

---

### Dynamic-runtime dev server

Dev-mode dynamic runtime containers start running `zsc noop` after
deploy — no dev process is live until you start one. Action family
on `zerops_dev_server`:

| Action | Use | Args |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | check before `start` (idempotent) — avoids duplicate listener | `hostname port healthPath` |
| `start` | spawn the dev process | `hostname command port healthPath` |
| `restart` | survives-the-deploy config/code change | `hostname command port healthPath` |
| `logs` | tail recent for diagnosis | `hostname logLines=40` |
| `stop` | end of session, free the port | `hostname port` |

Args:
- `command` — exact `run.start` from `zerops.yaml`.
- `port` — `run.ports[0].port`.
- `healthPath` — app-owned (`/api/health`, `/status`) or `/`.

Response carries `running`, `healthStatus`, `reason`, and `logTail`
— read these before making another call.

**After every redeploy, re-run `action=start` before `zerops_verify`** —
the rebuild drops the dev process (see `develop-platform-rules-common`).
The hand-roll `ssh appdev "cmd &"` anti-pattern is in
`develop-platform-rules-container`. See `develop-dev-server-reason-codes`
for `reason` values.

---

### Knowledge on demand — where to pull extra context

When the embedded guidance is not enough, these are the canonical lookups:

- **`zerops.yaml` schema / field reference**:
  `zerops_knowledge query="zerops.yaml schema"`
- **Runtime-specific docs** (build tools, start commands, conventions):
  `zerops_knowledge query="<your runtime>"` — e.g. `nodejs`, `go`,
  `php-apache`, `bun`. Match the base stack name of the service you are
  working with.
- **Env var keys** (no values — safe by default):
  `zerops_discover includeEnvs=true`. Add `includeEnvValues=true` only
  for troubleshooting.
- **Infrastructure changes** (shared storage, scaling rules, nginx
  fragments): see `develop-platform-rules-common`. For dev → standard
  mode expansion, start a new bootstrap session with `isExisting=true`
  on the existing service plus a `stageHostname` for the new stage pair.
- **Platform constants** (status codes, managed service categories,
  runtime classes): `zerops_knowledge query="<topic>"` — examples:
  `"service status"`, `"managed services"`, `"subdomain"`.

---

### Work session auto-close

Work sessions close automatically when either of two conditions hold:

- **`auto-complete`** — every service in scope has both a successful
  deploy and a passing verify. The envelope's `workSession.closedAt`
  becomes set, `closeReason: auto-complete`, and `phase` flips to
  `develop-closed-auto`.
- **`iteration-cap`** — the workflow's retry ceiling was hit. Same
  close-state shape; `closeReason: iteration-cap`.

Explicit `zerops_workflow action="close" workflow="develop"` emits
the same closed state manually and is rarely needed — starting a new
task with a different `intent` replaces the session.

Close scope follows the session topology: standard-mode pairs include
BOTH halves, so skipping the stage cross-deploy leaves the session
active. Dev-only or simple services close after their one successful
deploy + verify.

Close is cleanup, not commitment. Work itself is durable — code is
in git, infrastructure is on Zerops.

---

### `reason` values (DevServerResult)

When `zerops_dev_server` actions fail, the response's `reason` field
classifies the failure so you don't need a follow-up call to
diagnose. Dispatch table:

| `reason` | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `spawn_timeout` | The remote shell did not detach; stdio handle still owned by child. | You likely hand-rolled `ssh ... "cmd &"` — re-run through `zerops_dev_server action=start`. |
| `health_probe_connection_refused` | Spawn succeeded but nothing is listening on `port`. | Check that your app binds to `0.0.0.0` (not `localhost`), that `port` matches `run.ports[0].port`, and that your start command actually starts a server. Read `logTail` for crash output. |
| `health_probe_http_<code>` | Server runs but returned `<code>` (e.g. 500, 404). | Do NOT restart — it does not fix bugs. Read `logTail` + response body, edit code, deploy. |
| `post_spawn_exit` | No-probe-mode process died after spawn (port=0/healthPath=""). | `action=logs` for consumption errors; typical for worker crashes. |

Observable always: `running` (bool), `healthStatus` (HTTP status
when `port` set, 0 otherwise), `startMillis` (time from spawn to
healthy), `logTail` (last log lines). Use these to confirm state
without a second tool call.

---

### Per-service verify matrix

Deploy success does not prove user behavior. Use `zerops_discover`:
subdomain URL means web-facing; managed/no HTTP port means non-web.

Run `zerops_verify` first. If any returned check has a `recovery` field,
execute that recovery (`tool` + `action` + `args`) and re-run verify before
any browser/HTTP probe.

| Service shape | Required check |
|---|---|
| Non-web: managed DB/cache/worker/no HTTP port | Run `zerops_verify serviceHostname="{targetHostname}"`. `status=healthy` is enough; nothing to browse. |
| Web-facing: dynamic/static/implicit-webserver with subdomain/port | Run `zerops_verify` for infrastructure, then a verify agent using `agent-browser`. Tool healthy + rendered page proves the service; either failure blocks. |

Fetch the web-agent protocol only when needed:

```
zerops_knowledge query="verify web agent protocol"
```

It has the `Agent(model="sonnet", prompt=...)` template; substitute
`{targetHostname}` and `{runtime}`.

### Verdict protocol

- **VERDICT: PASS** → service verified, proceed.
- **VERDICT: FAIL** → visual/functional issue; iterate from the agent's
  evidence.
- **VERDICT: UNCERTAIN** → fall back to `zerops_verify`; the agent could
  not determine the outcome.
- **Malformed output or timeout** → UNCERTAIN; fall back to `zerops_verify`.

---

### Platform rules

Mount basics in `claude_container.md` (boot shim). Container-only
cautions on top:

- **Mount caveats.** Mount is the build source for each new container.
  Never `ssh <hostname> cat/ls/tail …` for mount files — SSH adds
  shell-escape bugs (nested quotes in `sed`/`awk` break). One-shot
  SSH is for runtime CLIs only.
- **Long-running dev processes → `zerops_dev_server`.** Don't
  hand-roll `ssh <hostname> "cmd &"` — backgrounded SSH holds the
  channel until the 120 s bash timeout. See
  `develop-dynamic-runtime-start-container` for actions, parameters,
  and response shape; `develop-dev-server-reason-codes` for `reason`
  triage.
- **One-shot commands over SSH.** Framework CLIs, git ops,
  `curl localhost` exit quickly — no channel-lifetime concern:

  ```
  ssh <hostname> "cd /var/www && npm install"
  ssh <hostname> "cd /var/www && php artisan migrate"
  ssh <hostname> "curl -s http://localhost:{port}/api/health"
  ```

- **Mount recovery.** If the SSHFS mount goes stale after a deploy
  (stat/ls returns empty, writes hang), remount: `zerops_mount action="mount"`.
- **Agent Browser** — `agent-browser.dev` is available on the ZCP host;
  see `develop-verify-matrix` for the web verification path.

---

### Deploy config — current axes + how to change

Each runtime service has three orthogonal deploy-config axes — the
rendered Services block shows them as
`closeMode=auto|git-push|manual gitPush=unconfigured|configured|broken|unknown buildIntegration=none|webhook|actions`:

- `closeMode` — what the develop close action does. `auto` runs
  `zerops_deploy` directly (zcli push); `git-push` commits + pushes
  to a configured remote so Zerops/CI builds; `manual` yields to
  you for orchestration. `unset` is the bootstrap-written
  placeholder that develop converts on first use.
- `gitPush` — capability state for the git-push path. `configured`
  means GIT_TOKEN + .netrc + remote URL are stamped; `unconfigured`
  / `broken` / `unknown` indicate setup is needed before
  `closeMode=git-push` can fire.
- `buildIntegration` — ZCP-managed CI shape. `none` (default),
  `webhook` (Zerops webhook drives the build), or `actions` (GitHub
  Actions workflow YAML). Requires `gitPush=configured`.

Switch any axis without closing the session — three actions, each
operating at a different scope:

- `close-mode` is **per-service** and accepts a multi-entry map: one call sets close-mode for any subset of services in one shot. For a standard pair, set both halves in the same call.
- `git-push-setup` and `build-integration` are **per-pair**: call only on the dev half (or single-runtime hostname). The handler rejects stage-half targets with `INVALID_PARAMETER` because both halves of a pair share the same git-push / build-integration capability stamped on the dev meta.

```
zerops_workflow action="close-mode" closeMode={"appdev":"auto"}
zerops_workflow action="git-push-setup" service="appdev" remoteUrl="..."
zerops_workflow action="build-integration" service="appdev" integration="webhook"
```

Substitute `appdev` with the dev-half hostname (or single-runtime hostname). For a multi-service project, repeat each call once per dev-half service — never per stage-half.

Mixed config across services in one project is fine — each service's three axes are independent in the envelope.

---

### Mode expansion — add a stage pair

The envelope reports your current service with `mode: dev` or
`mode: simple` (single-slot). Expanding to **standard** adds a stage
sibling without touching the existing service. Expansion is an
infrastructure change — it runs through the bootstrap workflow, not
develop.

```
zerops_workflow action="start" workflow="bootstrap"
  intent="expand appdev to standard — add stage"
```

Submit a plan that flags the existing runtime and names the new
stage hostname:

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "devHostname": "appdev",
    "type": "<same type as current service>",
    "isExisting": true,
    "bootstrapMode": "standard",
    "stageHostname": "<new-stage-hostname>"
  },
  "dependencies": [
    { "hostname": "<existing dep>", "type": "<dep type>", "resolution": "EXISTS" }
  ]
}
```

Bootstrap leaves the existing service's code and runtime container untouched,
creates the new stage service via `zerops_import`, and at close the
envelope shows both snapshots:

- the original (now `mode: standard` with `stageHostname` set,
  `bootstrapped: true`, `deployed: true`, strategy intact);
- the new stage (`mode: stage`, `bootstrapped: true`,
  `deployed: false`).

After close, run a dev→stage cross-deploy to verify the pair
end-to-end.

---

### Closing the task

Dev mode has no stage pair: deploy the single runtime container, start the dev server, verify. Run for each in-scope dev runtime:

```
zerops_deploy targetService="appdev" setup="dev"
zerops_dev_server action=start hostname="appdev" command="{start-command}" port={port} healthPath="{path}"
zerops_verify serviceHostname="appdev"
```

Each redeploy gives a new container with no dev server — check `action=status` first; if `running: false`, call `action=start`. See `develop-dynamic-runtime-start-container` for parameters and response shape; `develop-dev-server-reason-codes` for `reason` triage.

For no-HTTP workers (no `port`/`healthPath`), `running` derives from the post-spawn liveness check; `healthStatus` stays 0 — use `action=logs` to confirm consumption.
