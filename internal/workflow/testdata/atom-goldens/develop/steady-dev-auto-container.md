---
### Development & Deploy

Infrastructure is provisioned and at least one runtime already has a
successful first deploy on record. You're in the edit loop: discover
the current state, implement the user's request, redeploy, verify.

---

### Every code change must reach a durable state

Iteration cadence is mode-specific:

- Dev-mode dynamic runtime: edit code in place; reload via
  `zerops_dev_server` (no full redeploy for code-only changes).
- Simple / standard / local / first-deploy: every change →
  `zerops_deploy`.

Once close-mode is `auto` or `git-push` and every resolved deploy
target is deployed + verified, the work session auto-closes.

---

### close-mode=auto Deploy

The dev container uses SSH push — `zerops_deploy` uploads the working tree from `/var/www/<hostname>/` straight into the service without a git remote. Authentication is handled by `zerops_deploy` itself; no credentials on your side. The response's `mode` is `ssh`; `sourceService` and `targetService` identify the deploy class.

- Self-deploy (single service): `sourceService == targetService`, class is self.
- Cross-deploy (dev → stage): class is cross — emit `sourceService` and `targetService` separately.

```
zerops_deploy targetService="appdev"
```

`deployFiles` discipline differs per class: self-deploy needs `[.]` (narrower patterns destroy the target's source); cross-deploy cherry-picks build output.

---

### Dev-server state triage

Before deploying, verifying, or iterating on a runtime service, run
the triage rather than blind-starting a process.

**Step 1 — Determine the expectation** from `runtimeClass` + `mode`
in the envelope:

Only `runtimeClass: dynamic` + `mode: dev` needs a manual dev-server
action — its idle runtime container (no `run.start`) waits for
`zerops_dev_server action=start`. Implicit-webserver, static, and
dynamic + simple/stage are platform-owned post-deploy; triage ends there.

**Step 2 — Check current state** for dev-mode dynamic:

```
# container env
zerops_dev_server action=status hostname="appdev" port={port} healthPath="{path}"

# local env — runs on your machine
Bash command="curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' --max-time 2 http://localhost:{port}{path}"
```

Read the response:

- `running: true` with HTTP 2xx/3xx/4xx `healthStatus` → proceed to
  `zerops_verify`.
- `running: false` with `reason: health_probe_connection_refused` →
  start (step 3).
- `running: true` with `healthStatus: 5xx` → server runs but is
  broken; read logs and response body; do NOT restart (does not
  fix bugs). Edit code, then iterate per the mode-specific cadence
  (dev: edit + dev-server reload; simple/standard/local: redeploy).

For workers with no HTTP surface (`port=0`, `healthPath=""`), skip
HTTP status; call `zerops_logs` to confirm consumption.

**Step 3 — Act on the delta.**

```
# container env
zerops_dev_server action=start hostname="appdev" command="{start-command}" port={port} healthPath="{path}"

# local env
Bash run_in_background=true command="{start-command}"
```

After every redeploy the dev process is gone — re-run Step 2 before
`zerops_verify`.

### Checklist (dev-mode dynamic-runtime services)

Applies to **dynamic runtimes only** (Node, Bun, Deno, Go, Rust, Python,
Ruby, Java, .NET — anything with a long-running app process under
manual control). For implicit-webserver runtimes (`php-apache`,
`php-nginx`) the implicit-webserver guidance fires instead; for static
runtimes the web server auto-starts and this checklist does not apply.

- Dev setup block in `zerops.yaml`: **omit `run.start`**, **no**
  `healthCheck`. Zerops keeps the runtime container idle; you start
  the dev process yourself via `zerops_dev_server action=start` after
  each deploy.
- Stage setup block (if a dev+stage pair exists): real `start:`
  command **plus** a `healthCheck`. Stage auto-starts on deploy and
  Zerops probes it on its configured interval.

---

This service is on `closeDeployMode=auto`. Your delivery pattern is direct `zerops_deploy` calls via zcli — fast, synchronous, the canonical default for tight iteration cycles. `action="close"` itself is a session-teardown call regardless of close-mode; auto-close fires when the deploys you ran during iterations satisfy the green-scope gate.

## How auto-close fires

When auto-close conditions land (every service in scope has a successful deploy + passed verify), ZCP closes the develop session automatically. The deploys that landed during develop iterations ARE the close deploys — there's no separate close-time push, and no special call from the close handler.

The env-specific mechanics (SSH push from `/var/www` for container, `zcli push` from CWD for local) live in the env-scoped deploy guidance fired alongside this atom.

## When you might switch

`auto` is great for "make a change, see it live, repeat." If the workflow grows — multiple contributors landing changes, CI pipelines that should run before deploy, release branches — switch:

- `git-push` if pushing to a git remote should trigger the build (Zerops webhook or GitHub Actions). After the close-mode flip, `action=git-push-setup` provisions the capability.
- `manual` if external orchestration owns close decisions. ZCP still records every deploy/verify; auto-close just doesn't fire.

Switch close-mode per service:

```
zerops_workflow action="close-mode" closeMode={"appdev":"git-push"}
```

(Replace `git-push` with `manual` to yield to user orchestration.) The default stays auto until you explicitly switch.

---

### Development workflow

Edit code at `/var/www/<hostname>/` for each in-scope dev runtime. **Verify the dev process is up first** — every redeploy drops it, and the deployed-state axis only confirms a deploy landed at some point, not that the dev server is currently live. Run `zerops_dev_server action=status hostname="appdev" port={port} healthPath="{path}"` per service; if `running: false`, run `action=start`. **Code-only edits never trigger `zerops_deploy`** — deploy is for `zerops.yaml` changes only (see "**`zerops.yaml` changes**" below).

**Code-only edit cycle**:
- Dev runners with file-watch (`npm run dev`, `vite`, `nodemon`, `air`, `fastapi --reload`) pick up edits **only when configured for polling** — SSHFS does not surface inotify events. Set `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1` (vite/webpack), `--poll` (nodemon), or the runner's equivalent.
- Otherwise (non-watching runner, polling not configured, OR the process died), restart the dev server per service:

```
zerops_dev_server action=restart hostname="appdev" command="{start-command}" port={port} healthPath="{path}"
```

  The response carries `running`, `healthStatus`, `startMillis`, and on failure a `reason` code — read it before issuing another call.

**`zerops.yaml` changes** (env vars, ports, run-block fields): `zerops_deploy` first; the deploy replaces the runtime container, so on the rebuilt container use `action=start` (NOT restart) — every redeploy needs a fresh dev-process start.

**Diagnostic**: tail the log ring per service:

```
zerops_dev_server action=logs hostname="appdev" logLines=60
```

`reason` classifies the failure (connection refused, HTTP 5xx, spawn timeout, worker exit) without a follow-up call.

---

### Dynamic-runtime dev server

Dev-mode dynamic runtimes deploy with `run.start` omitted — the
runtime container idles and no dev process is live until you start
one. The dev server is unsupervised, so the URL 502s after any
container cycle until restarted: a passing verify means "live now",
not "durably shipped". For an always-on service use simple mode.
Action family on `zerops_dev_server`:

| Action | Use | Args |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | check before `start` (idempotent) — avoids duplicate listener | `hostname port healthPath` |
| `start` | spawn the dev process | `hostname command port healthPath` |
| `restart` | survives-the-deploy config/code change | `hostname command port healthPath` |
| `logs` | tail recent for diagnosis | `hostname logLines=40` |
| `stop` | end of session, free the port | `hostname port` |

Args:
- `command` — exact `run.start` from `zerops.yaml`.
- `port` — `run.ports[0].port`.
- `healthPath` — app-owned (`/api/health`, `/status`) or `/`.

Response carries `running`, `healthStatus`, `reason`, and `logTail`
— read these before making another call.

Don't hand-roll `ssh appdev "cmd &"`: the SSH session ends with
the call and kills the process. Always go through `zerops_dev_server`.

---

### Reference by name in container-side commands

When SSHing into a container to run a command that needs a secret
(psql, prisma, redis-cli, curl auth header), refer to the env var by
name in a **single-quoted** command body. Bash inside the runtime container
expands it at exec time from its already-injected OS env — the value
never enters your context.

Reference the name THIS service has in its OWN env: a var its
`run.envVariables` defined (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`), an inherited project
var, or its own secret. A sibling's bare `${db_*}` is NOT in your
container under the default service isolation — only the name your
service imported it under resolves.

```bash
# WRONG — value pasted from earlier discover output into the command
ssh apidev 'npx prisma migrate --url postgresql://postgres:U_UjIq5TC...@db:5432/db'

# RIGHT — single-quoted; $DATABASE_URL is apidev's OWN run.envVariables
# var (e.g. DATABASE_URL: ${db_connectionString}), expanded at exec time
ssh apidev 'npx prisma migrate --url "$DATABASE_URL"'
```

Same for `curl` auth headers (`Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN`),
`redis-cli`, `aws s3` — reference the name your service defined.

**Read vs use.** Inspecting values for diagnosis is fine — mask in
output so secrets don't enter your context:

```bash
ssh apidev 'env | grep -E "^(DB_|APP_)" | sed "s/=.*/=<set>/"'
```

If you DO pull values into context (export classification, debugging
an unresolved ref), the next command should still reference by
`${name}`, not the value you just saw.

---

### Knowledge on demand — where to pull extra context

When the embedded guidance is not enough, these are the canonical lookups:

- **`zerops.yaml` schema / field reference**:
  `zerops_knowledge query="zerops.yaml schema"`
- **Runtime-specific docs** (build tools, start commands, conventions):
  `zerops_knowledge query="<your runtime>"` — e.g. `nodejs`, `go`,
  `php-apache`, `bun`. Match the base stack name of the service you are
  working with.
- **Env var keys** (no values — safe by default):
  `zerops_discover includeEnvs=true`. Add `includeEnvValues=true` only
  for troubleshooting.
- **Infrastructure changes** (shared storage, scaling rules, nginx
  fragments): platform-rules guidance in the develop response covers
  base mechanics; deeper detail comes from `zerops_knowledge
  query="<topic>"`. For dev → standard mode expansion, start a new
  bootstrap session with `isExisting=true` on the existing runtime
  plus a `stageHostname` for the new stage pair.
- **Platform constants** (status codes, managed service categories,
  runtime classes): `zerops_knowledge query="<topic>"` — examples:
  `"service status"`, `"managed services"`, `"subdomain"`.

---

### Work session auto-close

Auto-close is gated on every in-scope service carrying `closeDeployMode ∈ {auto, git-push}`. Services with `closeDeployMode=unset` or `closeDeployMode=manual` BLOCK the auto-close trigger — the session stays open until you either pick a close-mode for those services or call `action="close"` explicitly.

When the gate is open, the session closes automatically when either:

- **`auto-complete`** — every service in scope has both a successful
  deploy and a passing verify; `closeReason: auto-complete`.
- **`iteration-cap`** — the workflow's retry ceiling was hit; same
  close-state shape, `closeReason: iteration-cap`.

Explicit `zerops_workflow action="close" workflow="develop"` emits
the same closed state manually and is rarely needed — starting a new
task with a different `intent` replaces the session.

Close scope follows the session topology: standard-mode pairs include
BOTH halves by default. For dev-only work ("leave staging as it is"),
pass `outOfScope=["<stage>"]` on develop start — the stage half drops to
a non-blocking reminder and the session closes on the dev half alone.
Dev-only or simple services close after one successful deploy + verify.

Close is cleanup, not commitment — work is durable in git + on Zerops.

---

### `reason` values (DevServerResult)

When `zerops_dev_server` actions fail, the response's `reason` field
classifies the failure so you don't need a follow-up call to
diagnose. Dispatch table:

| `reason` | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `spawn_timeout` | The remote shell did not detach; stdio handle still owned by child. | You likely hand-rolled `ssh ... "cmd &"` — re-run through `zerops_dev_server action=start`. |
| `health_probe_connection_refused` | Spawn succeeded but nothing is listening on `port`. | Check that your app binds to `0.0.0.0` (not `localhost`), that `port` matches `run.ports[0].port`, and that your start command actually starts a server. Read `logTail` for crash output. |
| `health_probe_http_<code>` | Server runs but returned `<code>` (e.g. 500, 404). | Do NOT restart — it does not fix bugs. Read `logTail` + response body, edit code, deploy. |
| `post_spawn_exit` | No-probe-mode process died after spawn (port=0/healthPath=""). | `action=logs` for consumption errors; typical for worker crashes. |

Observable always: `running` (bool), `healthStatus` (HTTP status
when `port` set, 0 otherwise), `startMillis` (time from spawn to
healthy), `logTail` (last log lines). Use these to confirm state
without a second tool call.

---

### Per-service verify matrix

Verify every service after deploy — deploy success ≠ working app. Shape from
`zerops_discover`: subdomain URL = web-facing; managed / no HTTP port = non-web.
Run `zerops_verify` first; a check with a `recovery` field → run it, re-verify,
before any browser probe.

| Shape | Check |
|---|---|
| non-web (managed / worker / no HTTP port) | `zerops_verify` → `status=healthy` is the whole check |
| web (dynamic / static / implicit-webserver) | `zerops_verify` → judge `http_root`: `httpStatus` + `bodyText` + `consoleErrors`; healthy + a real body (not a blank shell / error page, no fatal console error) proves it |

When `bodyText`/`consoleErrors` are missing, truncated, or the page needs
interaction / SPA routes / non-root / auth, drive the browser **inline** with
`zerops_browser`. Never spawn a sub-agent, call raw `agent-browser`, or use `eval`.
Internal-only service (no public subdomain) → `zerops_subdomain action="disable"` after deploy.

- **VERDICT: PASS** — healthy + real rendered content; proceed.
- **VERDICT: FAIL** — healthy infra but blank/broken/error page, or a failing check; iterate from the check's `detail` + render evidence.
- **VERDICT: UNCERTAIN** — no render data + URL unreachable; fall back to `zerops_verify`.

---

### Deploy config — current axes + how to change

Each runtime service has three orthogonal deploy-config axes — the
rendered Services block shows them as
`closeMode=auto|git-push|manual gitPush=unconfigured|configured|broken|unknown buildIntegration=none|webhook|actions`:

- `closeMode` — what the develop close action does. `auto` runs
  `zerops_deploy` directly (zcli push); `git-push` commits + pushes
  to a configured remote so Zerops/CI builds; `manual` yields to
  you for orchestration. `unset` is the bootstrap-written
  placeholder that develop converts on first use.
- `gitPush` — capability state for the git-push path. `configured`
  means the last `git-push-setup` probe **proved end-to-end auth**: the
  supplied token authenticates against the remote URL, project env carries
  `GIT_TOKEN` (sensitive), and the working tree's git config has its
  `origin` synced. `unconfigured` / `broken` indicate setup is
  needed before `closeMode=git-push` can fire (`broken` means a previously-
  configured token stopped working, e.g. PAT rotation).
- `buildIntegration` — the ZCP-managed CI shape that was picked. `actions`
  (GitHub Actions workflow + secrets), `webhook` (Zerops dashboard OAuth),
  or `none`. Requires `gitPush=configured`. The flag records the choice
  and the handoff shape (workflow YAML body / dashboard URL); workflow
  commit, secrets landing, and OAuth completion happen outside ZCP's
  reach and are not verified by this flag. Treat as "this is the
  integration shape we wired", not "the build trigger is confirmed live".

Switch any axis without closing the session — three actions, each
operating at a different scope:

- `close-mode` is **per-pair** under the hood (one ServiceMeta per dev/stage pair) but accepts a multi-entry map: one call sets close-mode for any subset of services. Passing both halves of a pair with the SAME value is accepted (canonical write once). Passing both halves with DIFFERENT values is rejected with an explicit conflict diagnostic — pick one value for the pair.
- `git-push-setup` and `build-integration` are **per-pair**: capability is stamped on the dev half's meta and shared by both halves. `git-push-setup` rejects stage-half input with `INVALID_PARAMETER` (it mutates push-side state — would write to the wrong target). `build-integration` is permissive: pair-keyed lookup resolves either half to the dev meta and the response carries `pushSource`/`buildTarget`/`topologyNote` so the redirect is visible. Either way: prefer passing the dev half directly.

```
zerops_workflow action="close-mode" closeMode={"appdev":"auto"}
zerops_workflow action="git-push-setup" service="appdev" remoteUrl="..."
zerops_workflow action="build-integration" service="appdev" integration="actions"
```

Substitute `appdev` with the dev-half hostname (or single-runtime hostname). For a multi-service project, repeat each call once per dev-half service — never per stage-half.

Mixed config across services in one project is fine — each service's three axes are independent in the envelope.

---

### Mode expansion — add a stage pair

This atom fires once per in-scope `mode: dev` or `mode: simple` (single-slot) service — for each, expanding to **standard** adds a stage sibling without touching the existing service. Expansion is an infrastructure change — it runs through the bootstrap workflow, not develop. Repeat the procedure below per service when multiple in-scope services need stage pairs.

```
zerops_workflow action="start" workflow="bootstrap"
  intent="expand appdev to standard — add stage"
```

Submit a plan that flags the existing runtime and names the new
stage hostname:

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "devHostname": "appdev",
    "type": "<same type as current service>",
    "isExisting": true,
    "bootstrapMode": "standard",
    "stageHostname": "<new-stage-hostname>"
  },
  "dependencies": [
    { "hostname": "<existing dep>", "type": "<dep type>", "resolution": "EXISTS" }
  ]
}
```

Bootstrap leaves the existing service's code and runtime container untouched,
creates the new stage service via `zerops_import`, and at close the
envelope shows both snapshots:

- the original (now `mode: standard` with `stageHostname` set,
  `bootstrapped: true`, `deployed: true`, strategy intact);
- the new stage (`mode: stage`, `bootstrapped: true`,
  `deployed: false`).

After close, run a dev→stage cross-deploy to verify the pair
end-to-end.

---

### Closing the task

Dev mode has no stage pair: deploy the single runtime container, start the dev server, verify. Run for each in-scope dev runtime:

```
zerops_deploy targetService="appdev" setup="dev"
zerops_dev_server action=start hostname="appdev" command="{start-command}" port={port} healthPath="{path}"
zerops_verify serviceHostname="appdev"
```

Each redeploy gives a new container with no dev server — check `action=status` first; if `running: false`, call `action=start`. The response carries `running`, `healthStatus`, `startMillis`, and on failure a `reason` code — read it before issuing another call.

For no-HTTP workers (no `port`/`healthPath`), `running` derives from the post-spawn liveness check; `healthStatus` stays 0 — use `action=logs` to confirm consumption.
